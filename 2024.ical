DESCRIPTION:Many people rely on pollen forecasts to know when their allerg
 ies are likely to cause trouble. So when the main source of them in Finlan
 d scaled back after losing funding\, a replacement was needed. Hear about 
 the process of starting at zero knowledge of pollen forecasting\, discover
 ing the available models and data\, and putting it together to get 3-day f
 orecasts for any location in Europe\, as a hobbyist with some help from th
 e Finnish Meteorological Institute. Includes learning about atmospheric sc
 ience\, academic data\, coordinate projections\, Rust and more.\n\nLink: h

DESCRIPTION:During the pandemic\, trains got weird for a while. We weren
 ’t quite sure whether it was safe to travel collectively\, and the impac
 ts of that difficult time continue to shape our railway network to this da
 y. \n\nMeanwhile\, many of us were exploring our own\, hyperlocal neighbou
 rhoods on foot with obsessive levels of depth that we never otherwise woul
 d have got around to. (Was I the only one who highlighted every street I w
 alked in a London A-Z to see if I could get complete coverage?!)\n\nIn 202
 1\, I did a design-based MA all about railways\, railway infrastructure\, 
 and what it means to travel and live communally. To do this\, I walked all
  the way from London to Brighton (in sections)\, following the railway lin
 e as closely as possible. This is a talk about what I saw and what I thoug
 ht about\, and will hopefully be enjoyed by fans of trains\, hiking\, comm
 unity and travel. (And anyone else who fancies a sit down\, I’ll try and
  make it interesting\, I promise)\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedul

DESCRIPTION:Most technical people hear about fusion power in the news or s
 ee it in games and movies\, and are familiar with the joke that it's alway
 s 20 years away. Beyond this\, it's surprisingly rare to find good informa
 tion beyond the basic physics and the marketing promise of unlimited\, cle
 an energy.\n\nAs an engineer working in the fusion technology sector\, I g
 ive a primer on how fusion power works\, why its benefits are so incredibl
 y tantalising yet hard to achieve\, what the latest exciting developments 
 are\, and how the UK is a surprising trailblazer. I outline some of the cu
 tting-edge technologies involved in developing fusion power\, including su
 perconducting magnets\, plasma control using deep learning methods\, and h
 ypersonic fuel injection. The audience is also given facts and figures to 
 get a flavour of the unimaginable scale of what is being done: materials a
 t nearly 0K adjacent to plasmas hotter than the cores of stars\, gigawatts
  of power from teaspoons of fuel\, magnetic fields multiple times more pow
 erful than MRI machines\, and neutron fluxes strong enough to transmute ma
 tter in bulk.\n\nComing away from this presentation\, the audience will ha
 ve learned about the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and appreciate the key
  issues enough to put the marketing and news reports into context. They mi
 ght even be excited and enthused about what's to come in this quickly grow
 ing technology space.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/471-u

DESCRIPTION:Are you secretly a spy and/or passionate about open-source? Ma
 ybe you don't trust a cloud-hosted service with your highly classified inf
 ormation\, or perhaps you like to build things for yourself. In this light
 -hearted talk\, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-pow
 ered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations with
 out internet access\, using open-source components.\n\nOur journey begins 
 with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running 
 GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by
 -step\, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeli
 ne\, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer\, presented within
  a Streamlit frontend\, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight 
 Django API backend for storage.\n\nHere's why this matters:\n1️⃣ Cloud
 -hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.\n2️⃣ Goo
 d open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks\; the more people wh
 o use them\, the more they will thrive.\n3️⃣ Commercial tools will sol
 ve for common use cases\, but developers can build personalised tools that
  are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.\n\nThis talk is tailo
 red for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a pract
 ical demo come together piece by piece\, attendees will gain a deeper unde
 rstanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and
  be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device 
 computation in real-world scenarios. Expect plenty of Python code and some
  fun live demos\, with GitHub code provided for attendees to try it at hom

DESCRIPTION:This is a talk about how we combined textiles\, electronics an

 r this project\, we wanted to explore more the findings of previous resear
 ch around the guilt mothers feel when feeding their babies\, but in a more
  creative way. Coming at the project from 3 very different points of exper
 tise\, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.\n
 We asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding
 \, a topic often emotional and controversial\, and send a voice clip along
  with a piece of their baby’s clothing which we stitched together to cre
 ate a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic tou
 ch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes 
 are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through hea
 dphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that
  provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a gr
 eat conversation starter to share stories and create community. \nThe talk
  will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt\, a
 nd a few thoughts if you want to make one too. It will also include some o
 f our own reflections when working on a project that brings up difficult e
 motions and sensitive topics. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2

DESCRIPTION:This workshop is an absolute beginner’s guide to leatherwork
 \, covering the things that I wish I had known when I was first starting. 
 I intend for this workshop to be useful to people who have never worked wi
 th leather before and would like to learn the skills needed to start makin
 g or repairing leather goods.\n\nI will discuss the three main types of le
 ather and which to choose\; the basic tools you will need to start making 
 leather goods (and how to use them)\; how to dye leather\; how to attach e
 yelets\, rivets\, and buckles\; and the three main types of stitch.\n\nFor
  the practical part of the workshop\, you will be sewing a leather keyring
  using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piec
 e of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both
  beautiful and resilient. The leather\, thread\, and tools needed to creat
 e your keyring will all be provided.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost:
  \nSuitable age range: 12+\nAttendees should bring: Small sharp scissors w
 ould be helpful for cutting thread - a Swiss Army Knife would be perfect a
 s it can be carried safely.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024

DESCRIPTION:Pulling a shot of espresso sounds so simple - just pump some w
 ater through a bed of coffee grounds. But while it sounds simple\, many th
 ings can go wrong. What ends up in the cup can too easily end up bitter\, 
 sour\, watery\, chalky\, harsh\, or flat.\n\nSo how can you be an espresso
  alchemist\, and convert your bitter shots into gold?\n\nIn this talk\, I'
 ll cover the anatomy of what goes on during coffee extraction\, and the pr
 oblems that can lead to bad flavoured coffee. I'll also give a whirlwind t
 our of the different coffee machines\, equipment\, and hacks that are desi
 gned to make better espresso - both the high-value gadets and the duds. Yo
 u'll learn how to 'dial in' a shot to prevent it being too sour or bitter\
 , and what steps you can take to maximise deliciousness! \n\nLink: https:/

 because it is based on Arduino\, and it has a touch keyboard.  It also has
  a built-in speaker/amp\, so you can play/perform wherever you go.\n\nArdu
 Touch comes pre-programmed with a way nice 4-voice sawtooth waveform\, but
  can be easily re-programmed with other way different synths\, including a
 lready available drums\, drones\, noise\, arpegios\, and more\; or with sy

 enters as they each argue the case for one side of the battle between gene
 rations from large language models\, vs. more naive generation approaches.
  \n\nWe’ll explore what makes comedy funny at all\, and then drill deepe
 r into why we find content generated by computers so hilarious - often whe
 n it’s not trying to be! \n\nThroughout the talk we’ll give some examp
 les of humorous computer generated content from past projects - intentiona

  \nWhich parts of language models are the “funny parts”\, and what hap
 pens if you supercharge them? \nDo the people who attend EMF have an objec
 tively* good sense of humour? \n\nFinally we answer the most important que

DESCRIPTION:At EMF 2022 I ran a drop in sewing workshop. Whilst it was pop
 ular\, one question that I didn't have time to answer properly was the bro
 ad: "I want to make my own clothes: where do I start?"\n\nI'd like to answ
 er just that question in this talk. I'll cover things like: tools/equipmen
 t you need (and what you don't!)\, how to read a sewing pattern\, key thin
 gs to remember and suggestions for easy projects to get started with. \n\n
 I've previously worked costuming for theatre and designing/making wedding 
 dresses. Whilst my main focus has been on garment sewing\, I'm happy to he
 lp people with their wild projects: how to make your projects waterproof\,
  how to make wacky shapes and how to work with weird fabrics are all thing
 s I can help with. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/258-sea

DESCRIPTION:Gas boilers\, almost all homes in the UK have them\, but they 
 are dreadful!\n+90% of the ones I've seen are badly spec'ed and horribly c
 onfigured\, so they burn way too much gas.\nThen Martin Lewis keeps tellin
 g us to "lower the flow temperature" but it's never really explained how t
 o\, or what this does to save gas (and money). \n\nWell have I got a Slide
  Deck for you!!\n\nAs with any serious problem\, it needs hard data. So I 
 wired my Raspberry Pi home server to my central heating controls\, wrote a
  bunch of code\, and spent last winter collecting data from my boiler\, a 
 dozen temperature sensors\, some humidity sensors and the Octopus Energy A
 PI.\n\nI have pretty graphs to show what happens all around my home\, how 
 altering the flow temperature works\, how altering set points work\, why m
 y house was too cold\, then too hot\, and used way too much gas. \nI'll ex
 plain the (simple) physics and how to tweak your system for best performan
 ce too. \n\nBut ultimately\, we all have to stop burning gas and move to h
 eat pumps\, a solution not understood by many and requiring something of a
  mind shift from the way gas central heating has always worked. I'll expla
 in how heat pumps work and what you can do to prepare for their arrival in
  your home.\n\nThe future is bright\, and it's heading rapidly in this dir
 ection.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/161-gas-boilers-suc

DESCRIPTION:Over the past five decades\, the concert & live event industry
  has undergone a dramatic transformation into a major sector of the econom
 y\, with the production playing a pivotal role. Artists and their shows co
 nstantly seek the latest lighting & video technology\, intricate stage set
 ups\, and top-notch audio quality to dazzle fans. Ticket sales are a major
  revenue stream for Artists\, and a high-quality production show\, sells t
 ickets.\n\nThis high level of production is only possible because of an in
 dustry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a
  hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up\, operating\, and dismantlin
 g these elaborate stage setups\, often in a new venue\, on a daily basis. 
 Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together\, roadies n
 ow navigate highly sophisticated AV control systems supported by intricate
  network infrastructures.\n\nA vast array of specialised hardware caters s
 pecifically to live events\, engineered to be both flexible for on-the-fly
  adjustments and durable for daily setup and teardown. Reliability is para
 mount\, with equipment expected to perform flawlessly show after show\, ne
 ver missing a beat. \n\nIn this talk we are going to take an overview into
  the world of live event production\, shedding light on how roadies consis
 tently deliver stellar performances day in and day out. We'll explore the 
 intricacies of AV networks\, offering an insightful overview of the behind
 -the-scenes magic that brings unforgettable concerts to life.\n\n\nLink: h

DESCRIPTION:Earlier this year\, a developer was trying to benchmark a data
 base. But something was wrong - SSH was taking up too much CPU time in the
  background. This accidental observation led to the discovery of an audaci
 ous attempt to introduce a backdoor that would allow an attacker access to
  almost any system in the world running SSH\, an attack made up of both te
 chnical and social components.\n\nThis talk will describe the backdoor its
 elf\, the process that went into it being possible to inject in the first 
 place\, and how this was exacerbated by a series of entirely reasonable de
 cisions on the part of Linux distributions. It's a story of social enginee
 ring\, novel obfuscation mechanisms\, and a long con over several years. W
 e'll delve into why distributions patch upstream code\, why dependency cha
 ins are complicated\, and how it's even possible for a compression library
  to break all the SSH security mechanisms that are intended to prevent thi
 s sort of thing from happening in the first place.\n\nLink: https://www.em

DESCRIPTION:Caves present a challenging environment to survey and map. Con

 measures and paper and pencil\, to laser measures\, bluetooth data transfe
 r and PDAs or mobile phones as recording and drawing devices. Then once th
 e data is collected underground\, how open source software has been develo
 ped by cavers to process the data and draw maps which adjust to later chan
 ges in positions of parts of the cave when more data is collected or corre
 cted. We'll look at loop closures\, explorations of places no person has g
 one before\, and different ways to present a 3 dimensional map of a 70km c
 ave system. There will be plenty of photographs and video clips of cave ex
 ploration\, along with live software demos and viewing of digital maps.\n\

  huge problem when everything from lights to locks is powered by simple sp
 ells that everyone (save a few unfortunate "Undevelopeds") can do. After y
 ears of feeling useless\, Hex seizes the chance to change her future by jo
 urneying to the Wishing Wyrm\, a legendary dragon that will grant a single
  wish once a century. Unfortunately\, Hex isn't the only one after the wis
 h\, and every rival wish hunter has magic on their side. Every rival excep
 t the Clanksmiths\, Cam and Fuse. Like Hex\, they can't do magic\, but the
 y've learned to build clank\, creations made using the mysterious\, forgot
 ten arts of science and engineering.\n\nAfter a fairy fiasco throws Hex an
 d the Clanksmiths together\, they agree to cooperate - for the time being.
  With the Clanksmiths' know-how and Hex's creativity\, they outsmart monst
 ers with everything from LEDs to electromagnets to water balloon launchers
 . But as they race to the Wishing Wyrm\, Hex must decide between her frien
 dship with the Clanksmiths and the wish that would give her a normal\, mag
 ical life.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: \nSuitable age range: All

DESCRIPTION:I’m an archivist. Every day I deal with the records that peo

 e sublime (Royal wills\, lost love letters\, newspapers announcing the Tit
 anic’s demise) to the ridiculous (broken chips of wax from old seals\, I
 OUs from unknown persons\, too much human hair).\n\nA key role of an archi
 vist is to decide what to save and what to destroy. But this is the past. 
 Today most records are no longer on paper but sent in the form of bytes an
 d I’ve started to wonder what the point of my job really is? We have fre
 e access to near-unlimited email inboxes\, all our photos are backed up to
  the cloud to access from anywhere\, and instant messaging is synced betwe
 en our devices. Why bother deciding what to keep for posterity? Just save 
 everything\, let computers do the hard work\, and all will be well. \n\nTh
 is approach unsettled me so much that I set off to explore what it would r
 eally mean if we “saved everything”: how this would affect our world\,
  communities\, and ourselves as humans. In this talk\, I will share this j
 ourney and my thoughts with you\, and try to persuade you that my job is n

DESCRIPTION:Single Sign-On (SSO) is sold as a way to\n•	centralize manag
 ing your organization’s users\,\n•	make life easier for your colleague
 s\, and\n•	enforce consistent security standards.\nBut SSO protocols are
  just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenti
 cated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor “
 yeah\, that’s Bob” doesn’t tell me what the vendor does with this in
 formation\, or if the vendor always asks me who’s coming in the door.\nA
  bad SSO implementation can make you think you’re safer\, while hiding a
 ll the new and fun things that have gone wrong.\nTo get the most out of im
 plementing SSO\, I need to know what I’m trying to accomplish and what s
 teps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set 
 up carefully\, for each of the things you need to do right\, I’ll give y
 ou some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wron
 g. We all learn from failure\, right???\nI’m sharing this info because t
 his year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at wor
 k. It turns out that I’m good at asking weird questions\, and it’s an 
 extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be\, then yo
 u know where they could be broken\, and you can ask your vendors (and your
  colleagues!) “weird questions” before an adversary does.\n\n\nLink: h

  to access the same mobile network in a field? Satellites\, of course! Aft
 er facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK festival\,
  we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium sat
 ellite constellation hardware on eBay. When they arrived\, we surveyed wha
 t we had purchased\, discovered it was ex-Ministry of Defense hardware\, a
 nd hasn’t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers a
 nd making the relevant disclosures\, we worked to reverse engineer the har
 dware and get some usable data transmitting into space (and back down).\n\
 nThis involved dumping the firmware of the chip\, and stepping bit-by-bit 
 through the memory to understand what was happening\, as well as a few cas
 ual emails to defence contractors. Getting airtime for satellite hardware 
 was also a challenge\, and working around the intricacies of Iridium Short
  Burst Data. Furthermore\, we’ve developed the concept into an interacti

 cause only about 12% of leading roles go to women. Films made by or for wo

DESCRIPTION:It sounds easy enough: build a clock that always shows the cor
 rect local time\, no matter where you take it. Mobile phones can sort-of d
 o this\, but they manage by listening to the cell towers\, so this won't w
 ork everywhere. "Radio controlled" clocks just listen to a low frequency b
 roadcast\, there's a few different transmissions across the world but they
 're incompatible and know nothing of time zones. Desktop computers can use
  the internet for time\, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in
 .\n\nReally\, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more tha
 n a GPS receiver\, which figures out the time on its own\, with no need fo
 r internet or cellular connection. It turns out that doing this requires a
 n on-board world atlas\, a spherical coordinate point-in-polygon algorithm
 \, and a complete database of offsets and daylight savings rules.\n\nI fin
 ally created a clock that automatically corrects itself as you carry it ac
 ross country and timezone borders. The journey to this point was so ridicu
 lously tedious that it borders on the absurd. In this talk I'll run throug
 h some of the highlights\, and of course no talk about GPS time would be c
 omplete without mentioning leap seconds\, which cause problems even when t

DESCRIPTION:If you are a British nerd of a certain age\, you almost certai
 nly played Elite on the BBC Micro. And if you didn't\, this talk will expl
 ain why you should care about a now 40-year-old game.\n\nIt was years ahea
 d of its time\, with 3D graphics\, a procedurally generated open world\, a
 nd a whole novel's worth of lore - all running on an 8-bit home microcompu
 ter in 1984\, when most games were little more advanced than Pac-Man or Sp
 ace Invaders.\n\nOver the last few years\, I've been picking apart the ori
 ginal Elite game engine to understand how it worked\, and also to experime
 nt with extending it.\n\nIn this talk\, I'll examine some of the methods t
 hat the game used - how it used the graphics hardware\, how the game state
  is represented in memory\, how the ship models were designed\, how the AI
  worked\, and how galaxies and planets were generated. I'll also explain s
 ome quirks of the game... including the real reason that docking was so ha
 rd.\n\nI'll demonstrate some new tools I've developed\, which access the g
 ame state in real time\, letting you experience the original game in new w
 ays - including an OpenGL frontend with VR support\, and an attempt to rec
 reate an arcade-style version of the game\, with an old-school vector disp
 lay.\n\nFinally\, if all goes to plan\, I will attempt to demonstrate some
 thing that was an impossible dream for 40 years: multiplayer Elite on the 
 original BBC Micro version.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024

DTEND;TZID=Europe/London;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20240531T200000
UID:2024-668
DESCRIPTION:The Most Sacred Friday Nite Rites shall be undertaken. As told
  by the prophet DJ Bad Boy\, we drink a bottle of Bucky and get out wur ch
 icken.\n\nThis blessed wine\, produced by Benedictine Monks in Devon\, blo
 ody England\, is carefully\, lovingly barrel aged to a smooth\, steady 15%
  alcohol and is imbued in a holy ceremony with a blessed 280mg of caffeine
 . Safe passage across the Border has been assured by the Buckfast Accord o
 f 1669 for even the bloody English appreciate that to starve Scotland of i
 ts key religious artifact will result in an invasive war and oppressive oc
 cupation. This is the source of the common phrase "Buckfast gets you fucke
 d fast" - the leading word "Nae" was dropped due to a misunderstanding of 
 intent during the Victorian era\, and now the phrase is a common celebrati
 on and acknowledgement of the intensity of the Rites.\n\nWhen consumed in 
 the appropriate manner (directly from the bottle\, completed in roughly 1 
 hour) it will aid you in seeing through time and being particularly of the
  moment. Often\, first time participants of the Drinkers Rites will find u
 pon completion of their experience that they have voluntarily shed themsel
 ves of all material possessions. This is to be expected - when you are acc
 elerated to the Blessed Plane of Existence\, the whisperings of ancient go
 ds and creatures that exist between dimensions will often assist the reali
 sation that material possessions are temporary\, but Tonic Experiences are
  for life.\n\nA note of caution to all prospective disciples\, however - t
 he intensity of your experience may transfer all the joy contained in your
  soul to be used tomorrow and expend it during the ritual. This transfer o
 ften leads to a despondent day\, where one reflects only upon the negative
  aspects of life. Do not fret\, to experience the highest of highs we must
  understand that with which it contrasts. The despair of the day after\, c
 oupled with the infamous Jakey Shakes and occasional rejections of all foo
 d and liquid are only temporary.\n\nThis is part of the journey as set out
  by The Wine\, produced by the most blessed monks of Devonshire. It teache
 s us that while all shall return to equilibrium\, to break from normality 
 for just a moment of time may bring incredible joy.\n\nWhy don't you join 
 Scots of all shapes and sizes at the nearest consular outpost on Friday to
  experience the Friday Nite Rites. It must be noted\, the numbers stamped 
 on the base of the bottle are a measure of ritual experience\, and acolyte
 s may start you on a high number (indicating low intensity)\, restricting 
 the blessed Number 1 bottle for only the most revered members of the encam
 pment.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/668-friday-nite-ri

DESCRIPTION:Critical research on digital influence and micro targeting has
  generally focused on privacy violations by commercial marketers and Cambr
 idge Analytica-style political manipulation. But increasingly\, the UK gov
 ernment\, police\, and security services are using these tools for public 
 policy. The targeted advertising and influence platforms give public secto
 r actors complex tools with which to target behaviour change communication
 s - allowing them to tailor nudge messages based on online behaviour\, int
 erests\, and fine-detail location. This is allowing the police to use targ
 eted behaviour change advertising to attempt to prevent crime before it ha
 ppens - but poses serious questions for accountability\, ethics\, and priv
 acy.\n\nDrawing on a dataset of more than 12\,000 government adverts from 
 the Meta Ad Library and in-depth interviews with law enforcement\, we map 
 the landscape of what we call 'influence policing' in the UK\, and discuss
  the ethical and democratic implications of this new mode of policing.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Let's make a computer game! Using the accessible and fun platf
 orm PICO-8 we'll work together to learn how to make a simple game\, includ
 ing everything from code to pixel art graphics and chippy sounds. \n\nThe 
 workshop holder has lots of experience from the platform and will help and
  coach participants to get the most of the workshop.\n\nThings we will cov
 er:\n- the basic game loop\n- moving entities \n- animation\n- collision d
 etection\n- making and playing sounds\n\nWe'll also look at some existing 
 games that showcase what is possible with the platform.\n\nAfter the works
 hop participants will have a base for a game which they easily can keep wo
 rking on by themselves if they desire.\n\nPICO-8 uses Lua which is an easy
  programming language to get started with\, but given the time limit on th
 e workshop\, basic programming knowledge is preferred. \n\nPICO-8 is can b
 e purchased and downloaded\, but there is also an educational version avai
 lable online that is can be used for the workshop.\n\nAttending this works

DESCRIPTION:I once accidentally got YouGov to poll whether it should be 
 ‘the data is’ or ‘the data are’. \n\nWhether you favour 'are' or '
 is'\, in many ways\, data is plural. When we talk about data\, we’re tal
 king about different things\, contexts\, needs\, and perspectives. Thinkin
 g of ‘data’ as a singular thing brings risks. We always have to set da
 ta in a more plural context and can never think about ‘just’ the data.
  And data we think of as being about us – singular\, as individuals – 
 is often about a plurality of others\, and its value – to governments an
 d tech companies – is in plurality or aggregate. All of this means we ne
 ed to rethink our approach to data and take a relational\, collective and 
 democratic - a plural\, political and human – approach.\n\nLink: https:/

DESCRIPTION:What does a computer programmer do if they can’t type code? 
 Speak it\, of course!\n\nLike many programmers and heavy computer users\, 
 I suffer from chronic hand pain aggravated by computer keyboard use (often
  called repetitive strain injury\, or RSI). After having mild symptoms for
  years\, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eve
 ntually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my sur
 prise\, it worked.\n\nSpeech recognition technology has advanced dramatica
 lly in the past decade\, but most people’s ideas about voice-driven UI a
 re based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa\, powerful 
 but imprecise tools like LLMs\, or special-purpose dictation tools. What d
 oes a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?\n\nA 
 small but growing community of programmers\, many affected by RSI\, have b
 een developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool\, cal
 led Talon\, to control my computer\, write and edit computer code\, and ev
 en to write my dissertation. In this talk\, I will live-demo how I edit co
 de by voice\, as well as tackling the following questions:\n\n1. What is v
 oice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?\n2. How do voice
  control systems like Talon work under the hood?\n3. Could voice coding ev
 er be *better* than typing?\n4. What can we learn from all this about desi
 gning voice interfaces for expert users?\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/

DESCRIPTION:Many security vulnerabilities arise from memory safety issues\
 , with conventional hardware architectures and the C/C++ codebase chronica
 lly prone to exploitable errors - a 50-year-old problem at the heart of co
 mputing.  \n\nThis talk will introduce CHERI\, showing how (finally?!) we 
 can do better.  The CHERI research project has developed a new architectur
 e+software approach\, using unforgeable hardware capabilities to implement
  pointers. Morello is an Arm experimental platform for evaluation of CHERI
  to explore its potential for mass-market adoption\, part-funded by the UK
 RI Digital Security by Design programme\, and other groups are developing 
 CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors\, including Microsoft\, Google\, lowRISC\,
  SCI Semiconductor\, Codasip\, and RISC-V International. \n\nThis talk wil
 l introduce the problem\, and CHERI and Morello\, for a broad audience: th
 e hardware extensions\, their potential for fine-grained memory safety and
  software compartmentalisation\, the CHERI software stack\, and machine-ch
 ecked mathematical proof that the architecture design provides the intende
 d security. CHERI complements alternative high-level-language approaches\,
  that would need code to be rewritten from scratch\, and we'll talk about 
 the often-low cost of porting code to CHERI. \n\nLogistics permitting\, I'
 ll bring a Morello box\, running CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI softw
 are stack - I'll present the talk from it\, and demo how CHERI prevents ex
 ploitable memory safety errors. \n\nThis is joint work by the CHERI and Mo

DESCRIPTION:Air pollution is a major public health issue but you’d be su
 rprised how few official monitoring stations there are in Europe. That’s
  an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent st
 reets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is wh
 ere citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.\
 n\nIn this workshop you’ll put together an air quality monitor made from
  an ESP8266 and a few sensors\, load up the firmware and connect it to the
  sensor.community network so that other people\, scientists and policy mak
 ers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We’ll
  discuss options for weather proofing\, where to place the sensor and how 
 to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. \n\nI will be s
 elling kits at cost which include:\n    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro 
 USB port\n    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor\n    - A 2m micro U
 SB cable\n    - F-F header cables\n    - An SDS011 particulate matter sens
 or\n    - A USB power supply **is not** included\, let's try to prevent so
 me e-waste by reusuing an old one! \n\nI currently have 10 kits including 
 the SDS011 for £40 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for £15. Yo
 u will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop an
 d I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.
 \n\nA special shoutout will go to anyone who:\n- Scrounges together the pa
 rts for a sensor purely from things they get at the camp!\n- Get the firmw

DESCRIPTION:A research project that started with the question\, 'what was 
 the average person in Britain eating 500 years ago?'\, and resulted in a r
 ich knowledge base of over 1200 native and naturalised plants with food us
 es. The vast majority of our modern foods originate overseas\, introduced 
 to Britain by colonialism and Victorian exploration\, and the global human
  diet now contains less than 100 plants\, with limited biodiversity.\n\nSt
 arting from the BSBI's database of native and naturalised plants\, over th
 e course of 3+ years I painstakingly reseached each entry for historic\, a
 rchaeological\, or ethnographically documented food uses. This body of anc
 estral knowledge could help provide local food resilience\, reduce the imp
 act of the plants we eat\, and better protect food supplies from climate c
 hange\, pollinator loss and disease. \n\nThe research is still in its raw 
 form as a giant spreadsheet\, so the first part of the talk will focus on 
 the process of research and identification\, and some of the trickier ques
 tions such as the difference between a food and a medicine\, what level of
  toxicity is tolerable\, and how to really define a native plant. The seco
 nd part will focus on some highlights of the results\, including obscure d
 isused vegetables\, native things you can still forage\, lost recipes for 
 brewed alcohols and psychoactives\, vegetables we've bioengineered for edi
 bility\, some exciting natural poisions\, and addressing whether or not le
 ttuce really exists.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/461-th

DESCRIPTION:In December 2023\, 172\,022 people were waiting for an autism 
 assessment. We know this because NHS England publish quarterly national an

 w is how long they're waiting for\, how many ultimately get a diagnosis\, 
 what the referral process is like\, or what support (if any) is given afte
 rwards - all of which is a postcode lottery.\n\nI lead policy at Autistica
 \, the UK's leading autism research and campaigning charity. I am also aut
 istic myself\, which sometimes manifests as a chronic inability to give up
 . That's why\, on 14th March\, I sent the same Freedom of Information Act 
 request to all 42 NHS Integrated Care Boards in England.\n\nWhat started a
 s firing off a few e-mails turned very complicated very quickly\; this is 
 a whistle-stop tour of redirection\, confusion\, and private outsourcing. 
 Over eleven weeks on\, I *hope* I'll be able to present a national overvie

 what we need to do about it.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/202

 \, we will explore this dynamic together. When the ethics are no longer fo

DESCRIPTION:Going for a job in the space industry may seem like a moonshot
  but it's actually much closer than most people think - and a makerspace i
 s a great place to start from. \n\nI now work in the space industry but be
 gan my journey into engineering just six years ago by joining a makerspace
 . Using examples from my own experience - plus some history - I’ll exami
 ne how the skills you can pick up as a maker translate over to the space s
 ector\, how there are plenty of similarities between hobbyist making and p
 rofessional space engineering\, and how Makerspaces teach skills that are 
 actually in great demand in professional engineering!\n\nWhere there isn't
  a direct link from makerspaces into professional work\, I'd like to go br
 iefly into what skills you should look to pick up\, and how to do it\, if 
 want you to go for a space job!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/

DESCRIPTION:It's 1975! You need a high-resolution computer display for fin
 e drawings (e.g. CAD diagrams). Memory's EXPENSIVE\, processors are slow: 
 what to do? Here's an analog solution to a digital problem: an unusual cat
 hode-ray tube that preserves whatever it draws with no flickering\, fading
 \, or any kind of refresh. A brilliant dot sears emerald trails into the s
 creen\, rendering intricate line-art without pixels. No need for video mem
 ory when the screen itself remembers!\n\nIt's mesmerising to see this spec
 ial tube in action\; more satisfying still to know how it works. Discover 
 a mechanism Tektronix refined over three decades\, growing from palm-sized
  oscilloscope readouts to 25" computer-lab behemoths. A wreath of electron
  guns\, kilovolt potentials\, microscopic cobalt cones\, and transparent a
 nodes set the stage for a nonlinear dance of charges that yields visualisa
 tions with style --- and we'll unravel its mysteries with animated diagram
 s. En route we'll visit notable storage tube applications\, from early com
 puter memories to 1978's _Battlestar Galactica_. Of course we'll see a rea
 l Tektronix terminal at work\, too!\n\nComputer memory is cheap now: by th
 e mid 1980s\, modern displays had advantages storage-tube systems couldn't
  overcome. Nobody's making them anymore\, so check out this talk while old
  stock still works!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/43-forg

DESCRIPTION:When we’re out and about\, text messages (and also voice cal
 ls\, mobile data etc.) sent and received through our everyday smartphones 
 are all routed through fixed land-based ‘cell tower’ antennas no more 
 than a few km distant\, which form what we might term a ‘Terrestrial Net
 work’ (TN). In rural areas\, we often lose cellular wireless signal enti
 rely\, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the U
 K\, EU\, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text m
 essages\, even emergency messages. \n\nIn the 1990s\, visionary scientists
  and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems\, using s
 atellites as their ‘flying’ cell towers. We will discuss an example of
  such a pioneering network\, called Iridium\, which has operated successfu
 lly from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today’s scientist a
 nd engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same ‘space-based’ 
 capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones\, without needing 
 to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device. This would allow our ph
 one\, when necessary\, to switch from the land-based TN to the space-based
  ‘Non-Terrestrial Network’ (NTN). In this presentation we will discuss
  some of the technical challenges in achieving this ‘Direct-to-Device’
  (D2D) satellite messaging feature\, and some of the solutions which are b
 eing proposed\, and even already being tested for real. One of the leading
  players in this space is Starlink\, so buckle up for a wild ride!\n\nLink

DESCRIPTION:Emily Peasgood and Mark Hanslip will present a talk on creatin

 in real-time. \n\nEverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the 
 lifespan of a person in a song\, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years
 -old at the end. It explores the fragility of life\, its circularity\, inv
 ites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our 
 legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. \n\nSince Januar
 y 2024\, Peasgood & Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC\, a newly-developed 
 process which builds on Google Magenta’s DDSP by combining it with a dif
 fusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 a
 nd trained models which can be mapped onto Emily’s voice enabling her to
  sound younger and older than she is. \n\nThis technology is starting to b
 e adopted by contemporary pop musicians\, high-profile examples being web 
 services such as Grimes’ Elf and Holly Herndon’s Holly+. \n\nEverSong 
 represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to h
 ear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathwa
 ys\, installed sustainably in nature\, touring before finding a permanent 
 home in an ancient site.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/12
