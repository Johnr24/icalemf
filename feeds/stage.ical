DESCRIPTION:Many people rely on pollen forecasts to know when their allerg
 ies are likely to cause trouble. So when the main source of them in Finlan
 d scaled back after losing funding\, a replacement was needed. Hear about 
 the process of starting at zero knowledge of pollen forecasting\, discover
 ing the available models and data\, and putting it together to get 3-day f
 orecasts for any location in Europe\, as a hobbyist with some help from th
 e Finnish Meteorological Institute. Includes learning about atmospheric sc
 ience\, academic data\, coordinate projections\, Rust and more.\n\nLink: h

DESCRIPTION:What does a computer programmer do if they can’t type code? 
 Speak it\, of course!\n\nLike many programmers and heavy computer users\, 
 I suffer from chronic hand pain aggravated by computer keyboard use (often
  called repetitive strain injury\, or RSI). After having mild symptoms for
  years\, in 2019 my hand pain worsened from irritating to unignorable. Eve
 ntually I got desperate enough to try to learn to code by voice. To my sur
 prise\, it worked.\n\nSpeech recognition technology has advanced dramatica
 lly in the past decade\, but most people’s ideas about voice-driven UI a
 re based on highly limited voice assistants like Siri or Alexa\, powerful 
 but imprecise tools like LLMs\, or special-purpose dictation tools. What d
 oes a voice interface for precise control by expert users look like?\n\nA 
 small but growing community of programmers\, many affected by RSI\, have b
 een developing tools that explore this question. I use one such tool\, cal
 led Talon\, to control my computer\, write and edit computer code\, and ev
 en to write my dissertation. In this talk\, I will live-demo how I edit co
 de by voice\, as well as tackling the following questions:\n\n1. What is v
 oice-coding like? What unique challenges does it present?\n2. How do voice
  control systems like Talon work under the hood?\n3. Could voice coding ev
 er be *better* than typing?\n4. What can we learn from all this about desi

DESCRIPTION:Are you secretly a spy and/or passionate about open-source? Ma
 ybe you don't trust a cloud-hosted service with your highly classified inf
 ormation\, or perhaps you like to build things for yourself. In this light
 -hearted talk\, you will learn how to make a real-time on-device GenAI-pow
 ered application that can live transcribe and summarize conversations with
 out internet access\, using open-source components.\n\nOur journey begins 
 with an introduction to open-source LLMs and the latest trends in running 
 GenAI tools on your own hardware. We will build up our application step-by
 -step\, first creating a live streaming voice-to-text transcription pipeli
 ne\, then an LLM-based conversation summarization layer\, presented within
  a Streamlit frontend\, with conversation summaries sent to a lightweight 
 Django API backend for storage.\n\nHere's why this matters:\n1️⃣ Cloud
 -hosted SaaS tools cannot store highly sensitive information.\n2️⃣ Goo
 d open-source alternatives exist for most GenAI tasks\; the more people wh
 o use them\, the more they will thrive.\n3️⃣ Commercial tools will sol
 ve for common use cases\, but developers can build personalised tools that
  are highly specialised for their own bespoke needs.\n\nThis talk is tailo
 red for Python enthusiasts and requires no ML expertise. By seeing a pract
 ical demo come together piece by piece\, attendees will gain a deeper unde
 rstanding of how to build their own complex Generative AI applications and
  be pushed to imagine what they could make for themselves using on-device 
 computation in real-world scenarios. Expect plenty of Python code and some
  fun live demos\, with GitHub code provided for attendees to try it at hom
 e.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/183-whispered-secrets\nV

DESCRIPTION:When we’re out and about\, text messages (and also voice cal
 ls\, mobile data etc.) sent and received through our everyday smartphones 
 are all routed through fixed land-based ‘cell tower’ antennas no more 
 than a few km distant\, which form what we might term a ‘Terrestrial Net
 work’ (TN). In rural areas\, we often lose cellular wireless signal enti
 rely\, even within highly technologically advanced economies such as the U
 K\, EU\, US etc. We then find that we are unable to send or receive text m
 essages\, even emergency messages. \n\nIn the 1990s\, visionary scientists
  and engineers developed alternative voice and messaging systems\, using s
 atellites as their ‘flying’ cell towers. We will discuss an example of
  such a pioneering network\, called Iridium\, which has operated successfu
 lly from the late 1990s right up to the present day. Today’s scientist a
 nd engineer visionaries are now proposing that the same ‘space-based’ 
 capabilities could be added to our everyday smartphones\, without needing 
 to purchase a separate satellite-messaging device. This would allow our ph
 one\, when necessary\, to switch from the land-based TN to the space-based
  ‘Non-Terrestrial Network’ (NTN). In this presentation we will discuss
  some of the technical challenges in achieving this ‘Direct-to-Device’
  (D2D) satellite messaging feature\, and some of the solutions which are b
 eing proposed\, and even already being tested for real. One of the leading
  players in this space is Starlink\, so buckle up for a wild ride!\n\nLink

DESCRIPTION:This is a talk about how we combined textiles\, electronics an
 d storytelling to provide a platform for people to share experiences. \nFo
 r this project\, we wanted to explore more the findings of previous resear
 ch around the guilt mothers feel when feeding their babies\, but in a more
  creative way. Coming at the project from 3 very different points of exper
 tise\, we worked with mums to design and make a touch interactive quilt.\n
 We asked mothers of young babies to describe their emotions around feeding
 \, a topic often emotional and controversial\, and send a voice clip along
  with a piece of their baby’s clothing which we stitched together to cre
 ate a special interactive quilt. The quilt is embedded with electronic tou
 ch sensors which activate the clips when the metal buttons of the clothes 
 are touched. By interacting with them you can hear the stories through hea
 dphones. All this results in a very intimate and emotional experience that
  provides a platform for visibility and understanding and we think is a gr
 eat conversation starter to share stories and create community. \nThe talk
  will include a timeline of how we created a digitally augmented quilt\, a
 nd a few thoughts if you want to make one too. It will also include some o
 f our own reflections when working on a project that brings up difficult e

DESCRIPTION:Alchemy is a misunderstood art. From Hellenistic Egypt through
  to the modern day\, the story of alchemical science teaches us about how 
 science has changed in the last 2000 years and how it has stayed the same.
  The influence of this ancient science resonates through our modern world 
 in scientific theory\, misconceptions and popular culture. Learn how ancie
 nt alchemists formed accurate predictive models of the material world arou
 nd them\, How the Victorians lied to you and possibly even the secret to m

 wired my Raspberry Pi home server to my central heating controls\, wrote a
  bunch of code\, and spent last winter collecting data from my boiler\, a 
 dozen temperature sensors\, some humidity sensors and the Octopus Energy A
 PI.\n\nI have pretty graphs to show what happens all around my home\, how 
 altering the flow temperature works\, how altering set points work\, why m

DESCRIPTION:Over the past five decades\, the concert & live event industry
  has undergone a dramatic transformation into a major sector of the econom

 ups\, and top-notch audio quality to dazzle fans. Ticket sales are a major
  revenue stream for Artists\, and a high-quality production show\, sells t
 ickets.\n\nThis high level of production is only possible because of an in
 dustry full of talented roadies. Behind every arena or stadium show lies a
  hundreads of engineers tirelessly setting up\, operating\, and dismantlin
 g these elaborate stage setups\, often in a new venue\, on a daily basis. 
 Long gone are the days of makeshift equipment cobbled together\, roadies n

 t pitfalls there were. How we allayed security concerns. What went wrong. 
 How we dealt with trolls. And why it was so important to be as transparent
  as possible.\n\nThis talk asks if we did the right thing? Should have don
 e something differently? Could we have been more open? Were the risks just
 ified? Was being Open Source a help or hindrance?\n\nThis is a personal re

 e into the fascinating world of motorising random objects and the art of u
 pcycling\, along with the myriad challenges we encountered along the way. 
 From designing our own lithium-polymer batteries to countless iterations a
 nd rigorous testing\, we'll discuss the intricacies of dealing with electr
 omagnetic interference\, experimenting with various motor controllers\, an
 d even designing our own from scratch. We want people to experience the sh
 enanigans we went through and the fun we had along the way to hopefully ge
 t more people into whacky-wheeled…..wehicles.\nBut it's not all talk! We
 're excited to demonstrate the trolley live\, allowing you to experience f
 irst-hand the joy and sheer mayhem it brings. Our goal is to inspire you t
 o embark on your own wacky-wheeled adventures\, learning from our missteps
  and benefiting from our advice and tips.\nNo Project is ever truly done l
 astly we want to look into the future: The intended use cases and how we a
 im to share our knowledge and plans with the wider community. Our commitme
 nt to openness and collaboration means that anyone bold enough to motorise
  anything around them can benefit from our experiences and insights.\n\nLi

DESCRIPTION:Earlier this year\, a developer was trying to benchmark a data
 base. But something was wrong - SSH was taking up too much CPU time in the
  background. This accidental observation led to the discovery of an audaci
 ous attempt to introduce a backdoor that would allow an attacker access to
  almost any system in the world running SSH\, an attack made up of both te
 chnical and social components.\n\nThis talk will describe the backdoor its
 elf\, the process that went into it being possible to inject in the first 
 place\, and how this was exacerbated by a series of entirely reasonable de
 cisions on the part of Linux distributions. It's a story of social enginee
 ring\, novel obfuscation mechanisms\, and a long con over several years. W
 e'll delve into why distributions patch upstream code\, why dependency cha
 ins are complicated\, and how it's even possible for a compression library
  to break all the SSH security mechanisms that are intended to prevent thi
 s sort of thing from happening in the first place.\n\nLink: https://www.em

DESCRIPTION:Caves present a challenging environment to survey and map. Con

 measures and paper and pencil\, to laser measures\, bluetooth data transfe
 r and PDAs or mobile phones as recording and drawing devices. Then once th
 e data is collected underground\, how open source software has been develo
 ped by cavers to process the data and draw maps which adjust to later chan
 ges in positions of parts of the cave when more data is collected or corre
 cted. We'll look at loop closures\, explorations of places no person has g
 one before\, and different ways to present a 3 dimensional map of a 70km c
 ave system. There will be plenty of photographs and video clips of cave ex
 ploration\, along with live software demos and viewing of digital maps.\n\

DESCRIPTION:How do you transmit data when there’s 205\,000 people trying
  to access the same mobile network in a field? Satellites\, of course! Aft
 er facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK festival\,
  we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium sat
 ellite constellation hardware on eBay. When they arrived\, we surveyed wha
 t we had purchased\, discovered it was ex-Ministry of Defense hardware\, a
 nd hasn’t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers a
 nd making the relevant disclosures\, we worked to reverse engineer the har
 dware and get some usable data transmitting into space (and back down).\n\
 nThis involved dumping the firmware of the chip\, and stepping bit-by-bit 
 through the memory to understand what was happening\, as well as a few cas
 ual emails to defence contractors. Getting airtime for satellite hardware 
 was also a challenge\, and working around the intricacies of Iridium Short
  Burst Data. Furthermore\, we’ve developed the concept into an interacti
 ve map that overlays the realtime position of the tracker\, and gives spee
 d and heading data.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/90-adve

 ctivism initiatives in games. She will draw examples primarily from the UN
 ’s Playing for the Planet’s Green Game Jam which includes ustwo games
 ’ Monument Valley 2's The Lost Forest. Surveys from the jam reveal how g
 ames can spur positive actions in real life.\n\nThen we take action -- thr

 women get pushed out of filmmaking and never really come back? What happen

  around the 10% mark\, even after #MeToo and #TimesUp? Female A-list stars
  still earn only about half as much as their male counterparts\, partly be
 cause only about 12% of leading roles go to women. Films made by or for wo
 men get smaller budgets\, smaller releases and smaller marketing spend tha
 n male-made equivalents\, and the picture is much\, much worse for women o

 fixtures rather than the performance this talk is for you. Or may you just

DESCRIPTION:During WW2\, British plane crews sometimes found themselves im
 prisoned behind enemy lines. With only light punishments for escape attemp
 ts\, some of these prisoners worked on incredible schemes to get back home
 . This illustrated talk will talk about these escapes\, from famous ones t
 o those that are undeservedly forgotten. It's a story of impressive creati
 vity\, of people trying to hack their way to freedom\, including tunnels\,

DESCRIPTION:It sounds easy enough: build a clock that always shows the cor
 rect local time\, no matter where you take it. Mobile phones can sort-of d
 o this\, but they manage by listening to the cell towers\, so this won't w
 ork everywhere. "Radio controlled" clocks just listen to a low frequency b
 roadcast\, there's a few different transmissions across the world but they
 're incompatible and know nothing of time zones. Desktop computers can use
  the internet for time\, but you still have to tell it what zone you're in
 .\n\nReally\, it should be possible to build a clock with nothing more tha
 n a GPS receiver\, which figures out the time on its own\, with no need fo
 r internet or cellular connection. It turns out that doing this requires a
 n on-board world atlas\, a spherical coordinate point-in-polygon algorithm
 \, and a complete database of offsets and daylight savings rules.\n\nI fin
 ally created a clock that automatically corrects itself as you carry it ac
 ross country and timezone borders. The journey to this point was so ridicu
 lously tedious that it borders on the absurd. In this talk I'll run throug
 h some of the highlights\, and of course no talk about GPS time would be c
 omplete without mentioning leap seconds\, which cause problems even when t
 hey don't happen.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/337-gps-t

DESCRIPTION:If you are a British nerd of a certain age\, you almost certai
 nly played Elite on the BBC Micro. And if you didn't\, this talk will expl
 ain why you should care about a now 40-year-old game.\n\nIt was years ahea
 d of its time\, with 3D graphics\, a procedurally generated open world\, a
 nd a whole novel's worth of lore - all running on an 8-bit home microcompu
 ter in 1984\, when most games were little more advanced than Pac-Man or Sp
 ace Invaders.\n\nOver the last few years\, I've been picking apart the ori
 ginal Elite game engine to understand how it worked\, and also to experime
 nt with extending it.\n\nIn this talk\, I'll examine some of the methods t
 hat the game used - how it used the graphics hardware\, how the game state
  is represented in memory\, how the ship models were designed\, how the AI
  worked\, and how galaxies and planets were generated. I'll also explain s
 ome quirks of the game... including the real reason that docking was so ha
 rd.\n\nI'll demonstrate some new tools I've developed\, which access the g
 ame state in real time\, letting you experience the original game in new w
 ays - including an OpenGL frontend with VR support\, and an attempt to rec
 reate an arcade-style version of the game\, with an old-school vector disp
 lay.\n\nFinally\, if all goes to plan\, I will attempt to demonstrate some
 thing that was an impossible dream for 40 years: multiplayer Elite on the 
 original BBC Micro version.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024

DESCRIPTION:As a semi-professional plane spotter when I hear or see an air
 craft fly over I will sometimes point at it. But I can't always tell if th
 ere's an aircraft flying over\, and I can't be awake 24/7 so I miss some\,
  which I find unacceptable. \n\nEnter the auto spotter\, a robot that is c
 apable of pointing at the nearest aircraft continuously.\n\nThe auto spott
 er uses 1090Mhz ADS-B Out transmissions to work out where the nearest airc
 raft is relative to its location and works out the bearing and elevation f
 or a pointer. This is the same public data that is used to feed flight inf
 ormation services and can be received by anyone with the right (relatively
  cheap) equipment\; all commercial and many general aviation aircraft arou
 nd the world use it to transmit their positions\, speeds\, altitudes and m
 ore.\nYou may have seen the pointer at EMF2022 (in between rain showers) a

 ta in a more plural context and can never think about ‘just’ the data.
  And data we think of as being about us – singular\, as individuals – 
 is often about a plurality of others\, and its value – to governments an
 d tech companies – is in plurality or aggregate. All of this means we ne

DESCRIPTION:A research project that started with the question\, 'what was 
 the average person in Britain eating 500 years ago?'\, and resulted in a r
 ich knowledge base of over 1200 native and naturalised plants with food us
 es. The vast majority of our modern foods originate overseas\, introduced 
 to Britain by colonialism and Victorian exploration\, and the global human
  diet now contains less than 100 plants\, with limited biodiversity.\n\nSt
 arting from the BSBI's database of native and naturalised plants\, over th
 e course of 3+ years I painstakingly reseached each entry for historic\, a
 rchaeological\, or ethnographically documented food uses. This body of anc
 estral knowledge could help provide local food resilience\, reduce the imp
 act of the plants we eat\, and better protect food supplies from climate c
 hange\, pollinator loss and disease. \n\nThe research is still in its raw 
 form as a giant spreadsheet\, so the first part of the talk will focus on 
 the process of research and identification\, and some of the trickier ques
 tions such as the difference between a food and a medicine\, what level of
  toxicity is tolerable\, and how to really define a native plant. The seco
 nd part will focus on some highlights of the results\, including obscure d
 isused vegetables\, native things you can still forage\, lost recipes for 
 brewed alcohols and psychoactives\, vegetables we've bioengineered for edi
 bility\, some exciting natural poisions\, and addressing whether or not le

DESCRIPTION:Single Sign-On (SSO) is sold as a way to\n•	centralize manag

 s\, and\n•	enforce consistent security standards.\nBut SSO protocols are
  just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenti
 cated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor “
 yeah\, that’s Bob” doesn’t tell me what the vendor does with this in
 formation\, or if the vendor always asks me who’s coming in the door.\nA
  bad SSO implementation can make you think you’re safer\, while hiding a
 ll the new and fun things that have gone wrong.\nTo get the most out of im
 plementing SSO\, I need to know what I’m trying to accomplish and what s
 teps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set 
 up carefully\, for each of the things you need to do right\, I’ll give y
 ou some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wron
 g. We all learn from failure\, right???\nI’m sharing this info because t
 his year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at wor
 k. It turns out that I’m good at asking weird questions\, and it’s an 
 extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be\, then yo
 u know where they could be broken\, and you can ask your vendors (and your
  colleagues!) “weird questions” before an adversary does.\n\n\nLink: h

DESCRIPTION:Critical research on digital influence and micro targeting has
  generally focused on privacy violations by commercial marketers and Cambr
 idge Analytica-style political manipulation. But increasingly\, the UK gov
 ernment\, police\, and security services are using these tools for public 
 policy. The targeted advertising and influence platforms give public secto
 r actors complex tools with which to target behaviour change communication
 s - allowing them to tailor nudge messages based on online behaviour\, int
 erests\, and fine-detail location. This is allowing the police to use targ
 eted behaviour change advertising to attempt to prevent crime before it ha
 ppens - but poses serious questions for accountability\, ethics\, and priv
 acy.\n\nDrawing on a dataset of more than 12\,000 government adverts from 
 the Meta Ad Library and in-depth interviews with law enforcement\, we map 
 the landscape of what we call 'influence policing' in the UK\, and discuss
  the ethical and democratic implications of this new mode of policing.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Few things are as polarizing today as the production of oil\, 
 and unconventional production (including 'fracking') is even more controve
 rsial. Whether you're for it or (more likely) against it\, it's well worth
  knowing what is actually involved in making it happen and where the real 
 risks are.\n\nThe presenter recently left a long career in the US oil indu
 stry and will give you a view into this world without any spin or agenda a
 nd instead give you the opportunity to deepen your understanding of what i
 t's really all about. What is 'unconventional oil'? What does the process 
 to produce it look like on the ground? What equipment is used? What are th
 e real environmental impacts (beyond climate change)? Whether you want to 
 geek out about heavy equipment or to become a more-educated protester\, yo
 u'll learn something new.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/5

DESCRIPTION:Computing is riddled with security vulnerabilities\, many of w
 hich arise from memory safety issues.  Conventional hardware architectures
  and the C/C++ codebase are chronically prone to exploitable errors - a 75
 -year-old problem at the heart of computing.  \n\nThis talk will introduce
  CHERI\, showing how (finally?!) we can do better.  The CHERI research pro
 ject has developed a new architecture+software approach\, using unforgeabl
 e hardware capabilities to implement pointers. Morello is an Arm experimen
 tal platform for evaluation of CHERI to explore its potential for mass-mar
 ket adoption\, part-funded by the UKRI Digital Security by Design programm
 e\, and other groups are developing CHERI-enabled RISC-V processors\, incl
 uding Microsoft\, Google\, lowRISC\, SCI Semiconductor\, Codasip\, and RIS
 C-V International. \n\nThis talk will introduce the problem\, and CHERI an
 d Morello\, for a broad audience: the hardware extensions\, their potentia
 l for fine-grained memory safety and software compartmentalisation\, the C
 HERI software stack\, and machine-checked mathematical proof that the arch
 itecture design provides the intended security. CHERI complements alternat
 ive high-level-language approaches\, that would need code to be rewritten 
 from scratch\, and we'll talk about the often-low cost of porting code to 
 CHERI. \n\nI'll demo how CHERI prevents exploitable memory safety errors o
 n a Morello box\,  running Arm CHERI hardware and a complete CHERI softwar
 e stack.\n\nThis is joint work by the CHERI and Morello teams at the Unive
 rsity of Cambridge\, Arm\, SRI International\, and the University of Edinb
 urgh. \n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/87-cheri-and-morello

DESCRIPTION:It's 1975! You need a high-resolution computer display for fin
 e drawings (e.g. CAD diagrams). Memory's EXPENSIVE\, processors are slow: 
 what to do? Here's an analog solution to a digital problem: an unusual cat
 hode-ray tube that preserves whatever it draws with no flickering\, fading
 \, or any kind of refresh. A brilliant dot sears emerald trails into the s
 creen\, rendering intricate line-art without pixels. No need for video mem
 ory when the screen itself remembers!\n\nIt's mesmerising to see this spec
 ial tube in action\; more satisfying still to know how it works. Discover 
 a mechanism Tektronix refined over three decades\, growing from palm-sized
  oscilloscope readouts to 25" computer-lab behemoths. A wreath of electron
  guns\, kilovolt potentials\, microscopic cobalt cones\, and transparent a
 nodes set the stage for a nonlinear dance of charges that yields visualisa
 tions with style --- and we'll unravel its mysteries with animated diagram
 s. En route we'll visit notable storage tube applications\, from early com
 puter memories to 1978's _Battlestar Galactica_. Of course we'll see a rea
 l Tektronix terminal at work\, too!\n\nComputer memory is cheap now: by th
 e mid 1980s\, modern displays had advantages storage-tube systems couldn't
  overcome. Nobody's making them anymore\, so check out this talk while old
  stock still works!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/43-forg

 d themes and ideas that we will present in this talk. The five themes are 
 Community\, Sustainability\, Software\, Hardware and Creative. Within each
  of these themes\, we've identified four main areas of concern. The purpos

 to decide what bits to do with which technique. \n\nI'll also show how I a

DESCRIPTION:Emily Peasgood and Mark Hanslip will present a talk on creatin
 g EverSong\, followed by an invitation to try their vocal transfer models 
 in real-time. \n\nEverSong is a sound installation where you can hear the 
 lifespan of a person in a song\, from 5-years-old at the start to 95-years
 -old at the end. It explores the fragility of life\, its circularity\, inv
 ites people to celebrate the moment we are in right now and questions our 
 legacy as humans moving into an increasingly digital age. \n\nSince Januar
 y 2024\, Peasgood & Hanslip have worked with DDSP-SVC\, a newly-developed 
 process which builds on Google Magenta’s DDSP by combining it with a dif
 fusion-based vocoder. They recorded vocal datasets with people aged 5-95 a
 nd trained models which can be mapped onto Emily’s voice enabling her to
  sound younger and older than she is. \n\nThis technology is starting to b
 e adopted by contemporary pop musicians\, high-profile examples being web 
 services such as Grimes’ Elf and Holly Herndon’s Holly+. \n\nEverSong 
 represents a new application of this technology by making it possible to h
 ear a voice age in real time. It will be experienced in tunnels and pathwa
 ys\, installed sustainably in nature\, touring before finding a permanent 
 home in an ancient site.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024/12

 an energy.\n\nAs an engineer working in the fusion technology sector\, I g
 ive a primer on how fusion power works\, why its benefits are so incredibl
 y tantalising yet hard to achieve\, what the latest exciting developments 
 are\, and how the UK is a surprising trailblazer. I outline some of the cu
 tting-edge technologies involved in developing fusion power\, including su
 perconducting magnets\, plasma control using deep learning methods\, and h
 ypersonic fuel injection. The audience is also given facts and figures to 
 get a flavour of the unimaginable scale of what is being done: materials a
 t nearly 0K adjacent to plasmas hotter than the cores of stars\, gigawatts
  of power from teaspoons of fuel\, magnetic fields multiple times more pow
 erful than MRI machines\, and neutron fluxes strong enough to transmute ma
 tter in bulk.\n\nComing away from this presentation\, the audience will ha
 ve learned about the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and appreciate the key
  issues enough to put the marketing and news reports into context. They mi
 ght even be excited and enthused about what's to come in this quickly grow
