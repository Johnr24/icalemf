  embraced macramé for practical purposes during their lengthy sea journey
 s. The Victorian era witnessed a revival of interest in England\, and thro

 and crafters exploring innovative designs and materials. Nowadays the craf
 t has evolved beyond its traditional forms and utilitarian purposes\, with
  contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with 
 knotting techniques.\n\nNo prior experience is needed—just bring your en

DESCRIPTION:This workshop is an absolute beginner’s guide to leatherwork
 \, covering the things that I wish I had known when I was first starting. 
 I intend for this workshop to be useful to people who have never worked wi
 th leather before and would like to learn the skills needed to start makin
 g or repairing leather goods.\n\nI will discuss the three main types of le
 ather and which to choose\; the basic tools you will need to start making 
 leather goods (and how to use them)\; how to dye leather\; how to attach e
 yelets\, rivets\, and buckles\; and the three main types of stitch.\n\nFor
  the practical part of the workshop\, you will be sewing a leather keyring
  using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piec
 e of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both
  beautiful and resilient. The leather\, thread\, and tools needed to creat
 e your keyring will all be provided.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost:
  \nSuitable age range: 12+\nAttendees should bring: Small sharp scissors w

 ke out to various events\, where we encourage people of all ages to take c
 ontrol control of the robots\, ...or alternatively\, we sneak up on people
  unsuspectedly and do robotty things.\n\nCrawlybots were born from talks w
 ith Bristol based\, robot friends during Covid times\, regarding active su
 spension systems <yawn>.  Many many experimentations later\, lead to a Cra
 wly prototype\, which 5 mins after turning on\, we realised it was not onl
 y adept and surmounting any number of challenging terrains... it was also 
 a fantastic dancer!\n\nFunding helped us build a troupe of 4 Crawlybots th
 at we have taken to many public engagement events\, and allowed hundreds o
 f kids to take control of the Crawlybots via remote control and FPV drone 
 goggles. The bots bring joy wherever they go\, across all ages\, even amon
 g hard hearted roboticists. \n\nWe pride ourselves on having all our robot
  'guts' on show\, so we can talk about all the great things like Teensys\,
  coding\, lipo batteries\, BMS's's\, esp32s\, 3D printing\, education\, le
 arning through play\, sustainability\, CNC\, laser cutting and all sorts o

SUMMARY:Build your own sensor.community air quality monitoring station!
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/London;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20240531T123000

DESCRIPTION:Air pollution is a major public health issue but you’d be su
 rprised how few official monitoring stations there are in Europe. That’s
  an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent st
 reets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is wh
 ere citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.\
 n\nIn this workshop you’ll put together an air quality monitor made from
  an ESP8266 and a few sensors\, load up the firmware and connect it to the
  sensor.community network so that other people\, scientists and policy mak
 ers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We’ll
  discuss options for weather proofing\, where to place the sensor and how 
 to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. \n\nI will be s
 elling kits at cost which include:\n    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro 
 USB port\n    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor\n    - A 2m micro U
 SB cable\n    - F-F header cables\n    - An SDS011 particulate matter sens
 or\n    - A USB power supply **is not** included\, let's try to prevent so
 me e-waste by reusuing an old one! \n\nI currently have 10 kits including 
 the SDS011 for £40 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for £15. Yo
 u will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop an
 d I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.
 \n\nI can accept payment in cash (exact change only please!)\, contactless
  or bank transfer. I don't have a physical card reader so can't accept chi
 p and pin payments only contactless. \n\nA special shoutout will go to any
 one who:\n- Scrounges together the parts for a sensor purely from things t
 hey get at the camp!\n- Get the firmware running on the EMFcamp badge!\n- 
 Makes an airquality themed Hexpansion for the badge!\n- Does something els
 e unexpected with the idea\, it's a citizen lead project after all!\n\n[1]
 : https://sensor.community/en/sensors/airrohr/\n\nAttending this workshop 
 will cost: £40 for a full kit\, £15 for the kit **without** the SDS011 a
 ir quality sensor.\nSuitable age range: All ages\nAttendees should bring: 
 A laptop and optionally a solering iron\, though some will be provided.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Over the last three years I have been making an instrument to 
 convert sound to light using reflected and refracted lasers. The idea was 
 to create a synesthesia between light and sound.\n\nNow with over 700 lase
 rs it is arranged as three self contained units that project onto a white 
 surface 5 to 10 meters away. It requires as much darkness as possible and 
 takes 2/3 hours to set up. The lasers and the motors that turn them (or th
 e object in front of them) are all controlled via midi making it a sort of
  light organ that creates something nobody has seen before.\n\nhttps://fun

 Touch comes pre-programmed with a way nice 4-voice sawtooth waveform\, but

 pread the tempeh love.\n\n"Rhizopus oligosporus" is a very robust culture\
 , which outcompetes any other bacteria and fungi. Provided you are not all

 tickle its feet\, and learn a bit about physical computing in the process!
  \n\nDuring the workshop you'll...\n-Cut and fold the parts for the robot 
 from paper\n-Connect the servo that drives the robot's arms to the BBC mic

 th simple electronics to build fully functional robots. \n\nYou can either
  borrow a micro:bit for the duration of the workshop or bring your own. \n
 Note that if you borrow a micro:bit\, you'll be able to keep your robot bu
 t you'll need to supply your own micro:bit at home to get it back up and r

 ipants will have the option to create personalised kits that can be taken 
 home to complete after the workshop.\n\n2d CAD is all that is needed but t

 reflections. Some beautiful maths and geometry mixed with some primary sch
 ool needlework\, do you remember doing crosstich in binca....\n\nThe laser
  cutting and etching will be demonstrated with video and a variety of meth
 ods to explore at home from using a printer\, Circuit or laser cutter will
  be shown for those who would like to experiment further.\n\nAttending thi
