DESCRIPTION:This workshop is an absolute beginner’s guide to leatherwork
 \, covering the things that I wish I had known when I was first starting. 
 I intend for this workshop to be useful to people who have never worked wi
 th leather before and would like to learn the skills needed to start makin
 g or repairing leather goods.\n\nI will discuss the three main types of le
 ather and which to choose\; the basic tools you will need to start making 
 leather goods (and how to use them)\; how to dye leather\; how to attach e
 yelets\, rivets\, and buckles\; and the three main types of stitch.\n\nFor
  the practical part of the workshop\, you will be sewing a leather keyring
  using one of the most common types of stitch. Saddle Stitch uses one piec
 e of thread with a needle at each end to create a stitch line that is both
  beautiful and resilient. The leather\, thread\, and tools needed to creat
 e your keyring will all be provided.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost:
  \nSuitable age range: 12+\nAttendees should bring: Small sharp scissors w
 ould be helpful for cutting thread - a Swiss Army Knife would be perfect a
 s it can be carried safely.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024

DESCRIPTION:Anyone can learn to solder!  And anyone can learn to make musi
 c\, sound (and noise!) with computer chips!  All participants will easily 
 learn all of this by making an ArduTouch music synthesizer from an open ha
 rdware kit.  This workshop is for everyone -- even total beginners.\n\nArd
 uTouch is designed for total beginners to learn to solder\, as well as to 
 learn Digital Signal Processing for making sound.  It is called ArduTouch 
 because it is based on Arduino\, and it has a touch keyboard.  It also has
  a built-in speaker/amp\, so you can play/perform wherever you go.\n\nArdu
 Touch comes pre-programmed with a way nice 4-voice sawtooth waveform\, but
  can be easily re-programmed with other way different synths\, including a
 lready available drums\, drones\, noise\, arpegios\, and more\; or with sy
 nths of your own making.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: 30 GBP (plu
 s optional 5 GBP for USB-Serial Cable for programming)\nSuitable age range

DESCRIPTION:Air pollution is a major public health issue but you’d be su
 rprised how few official monitoring stations there are in Europe. That’s
  an issue because pollution levels can vary a lot even between adjacent st
 reets so to get the best picture possible we need more sensors! This is wh
 ere citizen lead projects like Sensor.Community are doing amazing things.\
 n\nIn this workshop you’ll put together an air quality monitor made from
  an ESP8266 and a few sensors\, load up the firmware and connect it to the
  sensor.community network so that other people\, scientists and policy mak
 ers can see where the problems are and hopefully change something. We’ll
  discuss options for weather proofing\, where to place the sensor and how 
 to hook it into your own smart home setup if you have one. \n\nI will be s
 elling kits at cost which include:\n    - An ESP8266 Dev board with micro 
 USB port\n    - A BME280 Pressure/Temp/Humidity sensor\n    - A 2m micro U
 SB cable\n    - F-F header cables\n    - An SDS011 particulate matter sens
 or\n    - A USB power supply **is not** included\, let's try to prevent so
 me e-waste by reusuing an old one! \n\nI currently have 10 kits including 
 the SDS011 for £40 and an additional 20 with just the BME280 for £15. Yo
 u will need to bring your own usb power supply or plug it into a laptop an
 d I will leave the weather proofing up to you once you install it at home.
 \n\nA special shoutout will go to anyone who:\n- Scrounges together the pa
 rts for a sensor purely from things they get at the camp!\n- Get the firmw
 are running on the EMFcamp badge!\n- Makes an airquality themed Hexpansion
  for the badge!\n- Does something else unexpected with the idea\, it's a c
 itizen lead project after all!\n\n[1]: https://sensor.community/en/sensors

 rovide an excellent conversation starter during the festival and help to s
 pread the tempeh love.\n\n"Rhizopus oligosporus" is a very robust culture\
 , which outcompetes any other bacteria and fungi. Provided you are not all
 ergic to soy\, making tempeh is as safe as making other fermented foods (l
 ike sourdough or yoghurt). \n\n(Shout out to Maud and Antoine from Domingo
  Club\, wo came up with the idea of making tempeh in wearable petri dishes
 .)\n\nAttending this workshop will cost: 5 pounds\nSuitable age range: 6 t

DESCRIPTION:A modern spin on leather work. Laser cut leather pieces that c
 an be hand sewn together. A blend of maths\, technical drawing and modern 
 technology to create an easy to sew bag\, wallet purse\, bag tag\, or glas
 ses case. Different levels of challenge are part of this as the laser cut 
 holes offer many different stitching possibilities. \n\nKits will be provi
 ded with a variety of leathers (including eco and recycled leather) Partic
 ipants will have the option to create personalised kits that can be taken 
 home to complete after the workshop.\n\n2d CAD is all that is needed but t
 he magic is in the use of simple tools\; offsets\, arrays\, rotations and 
 reflections. Some beautiful maths and geometry mixed with some primary sch
 ool needlework\, do you remember doing crosstich in binca....\n\nThe laser
  cutting and etching will be demonstrated with video and a variety of meth
 ods to explore at home from using a printer\, Circuit or laser cutter will
  be shown for those who would like to experiment further.\n\nAttending thi
 s workshop will cost: £15-£50 depending on kits chosen.\nSuitable age ra
 nge: 12-99\nAttendees should bring: None. A laptop can be brought along to
