This is a private repo for my personal use, (updated as and when I remember to do it from my laptop!) shared publicly so I can link it with my Google Calendar.

This is unlikely to be up to date, so unless you are in fact me, please do not refer to this for the schedule for EMFCamp2024 (and beyond). Instead, please go to the website which can be found at [https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024).
