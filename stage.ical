DESCRIPTION:Using end of life or 'scrap' EV & Hybrid parts and opensource 
 firmware I'm making an electric motorbike\, having got tired of making dir
 ty diesel ones! \n\nThe scrapyards are now filled with slightly broken EVs
  and Hybrid cars\, and almost no one knows what to do with them. As a resu
 lt the parts they are made from are very affordable and available for repu
 rposing and hacking into your own projects.\n\nThe project is far from com
 plete so there is nothing to bring to the show as I was hoping but there i
 s lots to talk about and discuss regarding the state of play of hacking sc
 rapped and discarded power inverters. \n  \nThe motorbike project uses a b
 attery from a BMW i3 electric car\, the motor is from a Mitsubishi Outland
 er PHEV & the main power inverter for driving the motor is from a hacked P
 rius running open source firmware with the motorcycle running gear from us
 ed motorbikes and a whole host of other bits connected together in ways ne
 ver intended.\n\nThe project is only possible using the work done by the E
 V car hacking community Openinverter.org and their community forum which h
 ave reverse engineered the EV power controllers allowing you to run open s
 ource firmware on them with some minor alterations. \n\nLink: https://www.

DESCRIPTION:"The Enigma Machine was an electro-mechanical device used in t
 he mid-20th century to encrypt communications. An ingeniously simple and e
 legant combination of cogs\, wires and lamps\, all fitting into a portable
  case\, it provided some of the strongest encryption possible at the time.
  During various Covid-19 lockdowns\, I decided to re-enact this important 
 development in the history of computing\, through a project to build an En
 igma machine at home\, using modern components and digital design techniqu
 es. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and
  laser-cut wood\, and can be assembled entirely by hand\, with no gluing\,
  screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me abou
 t the challenges of electromechanical computing\, security and usability\,
  the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains\, and their impact 
 on computing. This will be followed by a Q&A and a demonstration where you
  can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encryptin

 surgeries and outright biohacking... come learn about the gender transitio
 n "secret menu"\, compared and contrasted with the traditional options.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Starting with a brief introduction to the concept of Sustainab
 ility and the Sustainability Triangle (Environmental\, Economic\, & Social
  Aspects)\, and introducing my background (exploring the contradictions be
 tween being an environmental activist and a chemical engineer\, working in
  oil and gas\, and moving to waste management). \n\nWe will then move on t
 o a number of short "parables" each exploring an interesting anecdote from
  my career\, and using them to show the inherent conflicts between differe
 nt sustainability domains. \n\n- Environmental: Bird Poo\, trying to convi
 nce a customer than sending skips of rubble for incineration "to avoid lan
 dfiil" was not in fact environmentally friendly\, despite their best effor
 ts to justify this based on the fact it contained some pigeon droppings. \
 n- Economic: Vibrators\, exploring the underlying reasons why my first day
  working in waste management\, comprised having to find a home of 80 oil d
 rums which had been inexplicably filled with sex toys. \n- Social: Chemica
 l Weapons\, how running a project to dispose of "orphaned" gas cylinders o
 f Chemical Weapons and Rocket Propellants discovered lurking in a shipping
  container\, gave me a fresh perspective on our duties to each other as hu
 man beings.\n\nDepending on run-time we may take in some other (sometimes 
 cryptically named) anecdotes such as:\n\n- Accidentally advising the UN En
 vironment Programme. \n- Arguing with DEFRA as a hobby.\n- Trying to under
 stand the environmental impact of shampoo. \n- "The million pound milk-bot
 tle". \n- "The gas man cometh".\n\nBefore finally approaching a short wrap
 -up segment with the goal (but not promise) of tying up those lessons into
  a cohesive take-away about how attendees can think about sustainability.

DESCRIPTION:The hurdy-gurdy is an ancient musical instrument (10th century
 ) with drones and melody strings bowed by a rotating wheel\, played by pre
 ssing keys which contact them at different points. It featured in TV serie
 s such as “Black Sails” and “Walking Dead” as well computer games.
  A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds ea
 ch and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes
 \, they are loud. For pipers\, practice e-chanters are available while not
 hing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as
  a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation\
 , with some internal electronics\, for my own personal use to learn a few 
 tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse\, a website for sharing 3D printed 
 ideas\, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This 
 open-source project has developed through many variations which I would br
 ing to the talk\, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gur
 dy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable k
 eybox for travelling. It is an electronic device\, with correctly placed k
 eys\, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications syst
 em for electronic musical instruments\, via a USB cable to an attached or 
 wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It 
 is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywh
 ere using headphones\, thus preventing eviction or divorce!\n\nLink: https

DESCRIPTION:In 1939 World War 2 started and the British Council—Britain'
 s shiny new organisation for overseas cultural relations and propaganda—
 inherited the suddenly-closed tourist board's film-making department. Tour
 ism films are no use in a war\, so the Council turned their topics towards
  more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade
  of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almo
 st totally forgotten in Britain. \n\nBetween 1940–1950\, the British Cou
 ncil produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain
  covering sports\, manufacturing\, landscapes\, art\, architecture\, publi
 c healthcare\, the justice system\, democratic process\, public institutio
 ns like the National Trust and the BBC\, and more besides. \nA far cry fro
 m the Ministry of Information's rigid style\, this collection features som
 e of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (200
 1: A Space Odyssey\, Cabaret\, Superman)\, and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of L
 ife and Death\, Black Narcissus\, The Red Shoes). \n\nDistributed to over 
 100 countries worldwide\, the films are stunning\, dated\, funny\, and biz
 arre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides\, optimistic cities\, str
 ong industry\, forward-thinking social structures\, and hardworking\, happ
 y people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that pers
 ists to this day... \nThat may not be a coincidence. \n\nIn this talk I'll
  cover the history and development of this film collection\, how it was sh
 aped\, who saw the films\, their staggering success\, and their untold glo

DESCRIPTION:Should we really be trying to make our tech indistinguishable 
 from magic? Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do wit
 h a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\n\nWe often hold creating 'a magical
  experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun\, engaging\, sometimes ev
 en playful\, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological ma
 gic has a dark side too\, especially when trying to help people learn and 
 feel confident about technology.\n\nBy its nature\, magic you experience i
 s not under your control: it's a trick\, and you're not supposed to be abl
 e to understand it\; magic is inscrutable\, and for many\, that's disempow
 ering.\n\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools\, we've tho
 ught a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides o
 f creating of a magical experience.\n\nThis talk will reflect on our strug
 gle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide
  a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\n\nIt will 
 explain how we attempt to present simple\, understandable analogs of more 
 complicated\, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense co
 nfidence with the tech around them.  However\, it will also look at how we
 've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make thi
 s all work nicely in a classroom.\n\nThrough this discussion we'll look in
  detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO\, the way the micro:bit'
 s USB interface works\, the microphone privacy LED\, the web-based compile
 r and the simple radio communication.\n\nFinally\, I will look beyond micr
 o:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can he
 lp us build better\, more trustworthy tech.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.o

DESCRIPTION:The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a critical element in t
 he success of the Apollo Moon landing programme\, and was one of the first
  digital computers to use the then new technology of integrated circuits.\
 n\nBy modern standards\, its design has many unusual aspects\, such as:\n\
 n- The logic circuits were made entirely from 3 input NOR gates.\n- Design
  was split into 24 logic modules\, but due to limits on gate/chip count pe
 r module\, individual gates were sometimes 'borrowed' from unrelated modul
 es.\n- Shift and rotate operations existed\, but were not available during
  interrupts.\n- Numerical overflows disabled interrupts.\n- There was no s
 tack.\n- Limited memory addressing range\, combined with a need for ever m
 ore memory lead to a complex memory banking system.\n- Word length was 15 
 bits\, ones-complement (mostly).\n- No floating point - everything done in
  integer\n- programmer responsible for avoiding overflows.\n- Single bit '
 Up/Down' Analog to Digital conversion (kind of) throughout\, with the curi
 ous side-effect that the faster the spacecraft was rotating\, the slower t
 he computer would run...\n\nOn top of the limited hardware was built an im
 pressive realtime system supporting cooperative multitasking\, a virtual m
 achine running interpreted commands\, a powerful fault detection and resta
 rt system\, and an innovative VERB NOUN user interface.\n\nThis talk aims 
 to describe the architecture\, with particular focus on aspects which are 
 unusual by modern standards.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2

DESCRIPTION:A few years ago at a virtual conference I related my story of 
 blowing up a BBC Micro B's power supply and alluded to the idea that it wa
 s (for totally anecdotal reasons) due to dark\, occult forces.\n\nThe subs
 equent year I realised that the best defense against accidental occult com
 puting was to do it on purpose so I embarked on a cyber-occult experience 
 to blur the lines between magic and technology\, beginning with writing a 
 Tarot card filesystem (TarotFS) on Plan 9 from Bell Labs\, the awkward cou
 sin of Research Unix.\n\nIn doing so\, I discovered a lot about the value 
 of participatory magical practice even when you don't believe in the super
 natural (and how we all do it whether we realise it or not)\, the surprisi
 ngly short history of the separation between magic and science\, and all t
 he weird junk you can do with Plan 9 under the guise of "occult research" 
 and how it's uniquely suited to the task.\n\nAlong the way I've gathered a
  collection of grimoires (spell books) and other occult texts that instruc
 t the reader on a plethora of "esoteric sciences" ranging from how to stop
  a magnet from working (you put a diamond next to it)\, how to appease all
  the gnomes that the earth is "full to the brim" of whilst you're searchin

 so far. Transport for London provides an API ("TrackerNet") to get departu

 .\n\nI'll explain how I built a system to squeeze useful insights out of a

 nds for TfL's capricious signalling systems\, way more graph theory than I
  have any right doing\, and why I now really hate the District Line. You'l

 me go from a chaotic jumble of data to a near-perfect model of the Tube ma

  getting banned by TfL for using their API too much or overloading the ser

 this talk should be appropriate for all audiences\, and should appeal to a

DESCRIPTION:Creative coding practices like live coding/algorave are often 
 described by the media as being of the future. For example in 2019\, wired
  magazine introduced live coding with the headline “DJs of the future do
 n’t spin records\, they write code”\, despite publishing very similar 
 articles previously in 2013 (“Hacking meets clubbing with the Algorave
 ”) and 2006 (“Real DJs Code Live”). In reality\, live coders are not
  DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way o
 f making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\
 nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding\, rather than the future 
 -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving an
 d braiding are classic examples\, highly developed algorithmic crafts foun
 d all round the world\, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look '
 heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns\, juggling patterns\, konn
 akol vocal patterns\, and kollam drawings\, and equivalent contemporary pr
 actices like bytebeat\, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\nIn the end we'
 ll ask\, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former? In
  particular\, what do contemporary 'digital' artists have to learn from cr
 aft-based heritage algorithmic artforms?\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.or

 ve myself right. Join me and my PowerPoint to find out why cancer causes m
 obile phones (not the other way around)\, how stingy single people are abo
 ut wine\, and why Italian yoghurt adverts are a force to be reckoned with.
  You'll learn the truth about online dating\, how not to create a pie char
 t\, and the real cost of having a million dollars.\n\nFact Machine is a st
 and-up PowerPoint show exploring how\, like some members of the mass media
  and political establishment\, you can use facts and figures to prove anyt
 hing you want—if\, like said politicians and media types\, you don’t w
 orry too much about the small matters of “the truth” and “journalist
 ic integrity”. Armed with a well-researched (and fully referenced) slide
 show\, I will take you on a journey through the minds of the statistically
  average single American: what they like\, how they spend their time\, and
  what they write when they leave online shopping reviews. Just don’t loo
 k too closely at how I apply the facts to reach my conclusions.\n\nExpect 
 bad puns\, even worse science\, and the statistical key to getting yoursel
 f a date on the internet—if you’re willing to be a little “economica
 l with the truth”.\n\nThis was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival
  Fringe in 2019.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/305-skylar

DESCRIPTION:Mathematicians of yesteryear\, with limited access to computin
 g\, solved difficult problems by a combination of genius\, vivid imaginati
 ons and hard work.\n\nIn those days\, human 'computers' were used to calcu
 late and tabulate the solutions to maths problems ranging from trigs and l
 ogs\, to astronomical\, nautical\, banking and insurance information etc. 
 However\, those human computing processes were laborious (thus expensive)\
 , and error-prone. The invention of mechanical and electrical computing de
 vices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage\,
  Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more
  cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays\, computers are immensely more powerf
 ul than they were in either Babbage’s or Turing’s time. We will descri
 be a few mathematical problems that computers can solve\, and present some
  of the key techniques\, such as step-by-step iteration\, recursion and Mo
 nte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools\, such as 
 calculators\, spreadsheets\, programming languages etc. These tools are th
 e present-day equivalents of Babbage’s and Turing’s machines\, and are
  available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathe
 matical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculati
 ng upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our live
 s and of the universe itself.\n\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/

 ay. By going for a walk with me around the camp — blindfolded\, using on
 e of my guide canes — you'll gain qualitative experience you can't get a
 nywhere else. \n\nSignup is now open: https://s.ai/emf/ws\n\n# Volunteers 
 needed\n\nI'll need assistants during the talk (on and off stage). No expe
 rience necessary — but brief training beforehand is\, preferably Thursda
 y (day 0) evening. Especially helpful if you have experience in aikido or 
 similar martial arts\, and are willing to be my on-stage uke during the ta
 lk.\n\nDetails: https://s.ai/emf#volunteer\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.or

DESCRIPTION:Just how effective are solar panels and domestic batteries? He
 re's several years of *real* data from UK-based solar panels.\n\nCan you g
 enerate *all* the electricity which your home will consume? \nWhat happens
  to the electricity you sell to your neighbours?\nDo they work during a po
 wercut?\nWill I have to change my lifestyle significantly?\nIs winter a pr
 oblem?\nHow long do they take to install?\nWhere can excess electricity go
 ?\nWould my roof be suitable?\nCAN I CONNECT THEM TO THE INTERNET?!?!?!\n\
 nThis is not a sales pitch. I'm just an enthusiast (obsessive?) who wants 
 to spread the joy of solar power. I can promise graphs\, drone videos\, gr
 aphs\, photos\, and more graphs!\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule

SUMMARY:Rewilding Human-Computer Interaction

DESCRIPTION:I'm an artist creating interactive installations. The hardest 
 part is devising open-ended interaction\, spaces that invite people to rev
 eal their authentic selves\, and to connect with those around.\n\nBut tren
 ds in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usa
 bility\, profit\, safety\, profit or 'sparking joy'\, or profit (it's usua
 lly profit)\, 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human
 -Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more plann
 ed it gets\, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make
  us human.\n\nCould it be another way? Presenting... \n✯✯✯ Rewilding
  Human-Computer Interaction ✯✯✯\nwhere\, instead of designing microm
 anaged user experiences\, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unk
 nown\, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not probl
 ems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from exi
 sting fully as humans. The solution is not more design\, but more wildness
 .\n\nSoapbox aside\, I do have a speculative project to share on this fron
 t.\n\nIn a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas\, we'v
 e been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance\, and from th
 ese devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement. Th
 e resulting system allows you to move through a 16-dimensional parameter s
 pace while following the intuitions of the body. As an entangled black box
  system\, I can't explain how to use it\, but it can be learnt by the body
  through exploration and play.\n\nWe have it here at EMF as in Latent Voya
 ge\, letting you navigate the hallucinatory latent space of an image gener
 ating AI.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/220-rewilding-hum

DESCRIPTION:In the 1960s\, Donald Michie built MENACE: the matchbox educab
 le noughts and crosses engine. MENACE was built from 304 matchboxes and is
  one of the earliest examples of a machine learning algorithm: initially\,
  MENACE is a very bad noughts and crosses but over a number of games it le
 arns better ways to play.\n\nIn this talk\, I will demonstrate how MENACE 
 and (simple) machine learning work using the copy of MENACE that I have bu
 ilt.\n\nLink: https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/58-machine-learning-wi

SUMMARY:Hacking the Radio Spectrum with GNU Radio

DESCRIPTION:The most profound change in radio technology in 100 years is h
 appening now.  Radios are transforming from the spaghetti of mind-boggling
 ly complex electronics into simple (but very fast) digitisers\, and all th
 e hard work is being done in software. Hence the name Software Defined Rad
 io (SDR).\n\nGnu Radio is a simple entry point to the world of SDR\, and a
 llows you to quickly prototype different kinds of radios by dragging\, dro
 pping\, and connecting functional blocks.\n\nI'll demonstrate\, and show t
 hat it's surprising what you can do with a radio receiver.\n\n\nLink: http
