This year the Maths Village will be one of EMF's Workshop Villages, hosting workshops from the main programme alongside their own content. Last EMF, we had a selection of hands-on maths puzzles, free maths magazines, interactive gadgets and games, dome-building workshops, face painting and a MathsJam evening. If you're a big maths fan already, or want to get into it (or back into it) you're welcome to join us to do some maths, and see what exciting stuff we've come up with this time.", "location": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.3776591363047714, 52.04081962164122]}}, {"id": 78, "name": "Poorly Located Prog", "url": "https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Poorly_Located_Prog", "description": "An erratic collection of makers, burners, goths and hippies from Cambridge here to have a good time and bring chaos and/or prog to EMF.", "location": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-2.375185588798985, 52.04170327000736]}}, {"id": 35, "name": "ECHQ", "url": "https://echq.org.uk/", "description": "Amateur Radio, Telephones, Communications, Retro Computers, etc. Made up of the EMF Hams (G1EMF), MastCar ARC (G1CAR), CuTEL, and friends.
